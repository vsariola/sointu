    Envelope: Designed to be released after two rows so the kick is active approximately half a beat @ 144 BPM.
    Distort: The envelope becomes more bell shape than a triangle.
    Oscillator: Pure sine, but modulated (see below).
    Filter: High pass filter to remove the low end.
    Push-filter-delay-addp: Parallel process the low end to add some reverb & add back to the signal, to add some tail to the kick. Used the exact same coefficients as the main reverb, so they appear in the final .asm only once.
    Envelope-distort-send 1: Quickly drop the pitch the oscillator from high to neutral.
    Envelope-distort-send 2: A sharp spike ~ 11 ms after kick start, to drop the gain around mid range frequencies.
