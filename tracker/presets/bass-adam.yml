    Pretty standard sawtooth filter bass.

    Envelope: The attack and decay were adjusted so that the sound is out when triggered every row at 144 BPM.
    Distort: The envelope becomes more bell shape than a triangle.
    Filter 1: High pass filter to remove the low end.
    Filter 2: Low pass filter, with the frequency modulated by the Send (starts high and drops low, for that snap).
    Envelope-distort-send: Make the filter 2 frequency drop quickly from high to low, for the "snap".
